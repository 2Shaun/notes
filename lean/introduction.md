# Introduction

Lean is based on a version of a  logical system called _Calculus of Constructions_ with _inductive types_

# Simple Type Theory

- **every** expression has a type
- in Lean, `#` represents a query to the system for information
- lean is a foundational system, i.e., it _defines_ but does not _postulate_ (axiomize)
## Symbol Shortcuts
  - `\r →`
    - r for right arrow
  - `\o ∘`
  - `\x ⨯`
